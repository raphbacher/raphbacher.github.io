# Biography
Like everyone else I'm searching.
But on a professional level my research interests dwells within signal processing (or data science to be cool) with applications in Astronomy, Earth sciences, Biology...
I like to tinker with computer stuff (aka a "geek") being languages (Python, Julia) or systems (servers, conteners, networks...).
